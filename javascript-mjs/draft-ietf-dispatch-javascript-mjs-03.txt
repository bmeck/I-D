                     ECMAScript Media Types Updates
                 draft-ietf-dispatch-javascript-mjs-03

Abstract

   This document proposes updates to the ECMAScript media types,
   superseding the existing registrations for "application/javascript"
   and "text/javascript" by adding an additional extension and removing
   usage warnings.  This document updates RFC4329, "Scripting Media
   Types".

Internet-Draft       ECMAScript Media Types Updates        February 2019


1.  Introduction

   This document updates the existing media types for the ECMAScript
   programming language.  It supersedes the media types registrations in
   [RFC4329] for "application/javascript" and "text/javascript".

2.  Background

   In order to formalize support for modular programs [ECMA-262] now
   defines two top-level goal symbols for the ECMAScript grammar.  This
   means that (in the absence of additional information) there are two
   possible interpretations for any given ECMAScript Source Text.  The
   TC39 standards body for ECMAScript has determined that media types
   are outside of their scope of work [TC39-MIME-ISSUE].

   It is not possible to fully determine if a Source Text of ECMAScript
   is meant to be parsed in the Module or Script grammar goals based
   upon content alone.  Therefore, scripting environments must use out
   of band information in order to determine what goal a Source Text
   should be treated as.  To this end some scripting environments have
   chosen to adopt a new file extension of .mjs for determining the goal
   of a given Source Text.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The media type registrations herein are divided into two major
   categories: the sole media type "text/javascript" which is now in
   common usage, and all of the media types that are obsolete.

   For both categories, The ECMAScript media types are to be updated to
   point to a non-vendor specific standard undated specification of
   ECMAScript.  In addition, a new file extension of .mjs is to be added
   to the list of file extensions with the restriction that it must
   correspond to the Module grammar of [ECMA-262].  Finally, the [HTML]
   specification is using "text/javascript" as the default media type of
   ECMAScript when preparing script tags; therefore, "text/javascript"
   has been moved intended usage from OBSOLETE to COMMON.

3.1.  Common Javascript Media Types

3.1.1.  text/javascript

   Type name:  text

   Subtype name:  javascript

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  charset, see section 4.1 of [RFC4329].

      goal, declares the goal symbol in the Syntactic Grammars of
      [ECMA-262] to be used while parsing.  This parameter is case
      insensitive.

   Encoding considerations:  Encoding is host dependent with differences
      in byte order marks, the charset parameter, and text
      preprocessing.

   Security considerations:  See section 5 of [RFC4329].

   Interoperability considerations:  See notes in various sections of
      [RFC4329].  This media type does not specify the grammar of
      [ECMA-262] used when missing the goal parameter.

   Published specification:  [[RFCXXXX]]

   Applications which use this media type:  Script interpreters as
      discussed in [RFC4329].

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s):  n/a

      File extension(s):  .js, .mjs

      Macintosh File Type Code(s):  TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  See
      Author's Address section.

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  The file extension .mjs must be parsed using
      the Module grammar of [ECMA-262]

   Author:  See Author's Address section.

3.2.  Historic Javascript Media Types

   The following media types are added or updated for historical
   purposes.  All herein have an intended usage of OBSOLETE, and are not
   expected to be in use with modern implementations.

   Optional parameters:  charset, see section 4.1 of [RFC4329].

      goal, declares the goal symbol in the Syntactic Grammars of
      [ECMA-262] to be used while parsing.  This parameter is case
      insensitive.

   Encoding considerations:  Encoding is host dependent with differences
      in byte order marks, the charset parameter, and text
      preprocessing.

   Security considerations:  See section 5 of [RFC4329].

   Interoperability considerations:  See notes in various sections of
      [RFC4329].  This media type does not specify the grammar of
      [ECMA-262] used when missing the goal parameter.

   Published specification:  [[RFCXXXX]]

   Applications which use this media type:  Script interpreters as
      discussed in [RFC4329].
