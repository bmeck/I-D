                       draft-bfarias-json-home-00

Abstract

   This document proposes updates to the media types, superseding the
   existing registrations for "application/javascript" and "text/
   javascript" by adding an additional extension and removing usage
   warnings.  This document updates RFC4329, "Scripting Media Types".

1.  Introduction

   This document updates the existing media types for the ECMAScript
   programming language.  It supersedes the media types registrations in
   [RFC4329] for "application/javascript" and "text/javascript".

2.  Background

   In order to formalize support for modular programs [ECMA-262] now
   defines two top-level goal symbols for the ECMAScript grammar.  This
   means that (in the absence of additional information) there are two
   possible interpretations for any given ECMAScript Source Text.  The
   TC39 standards body for ECMAScript has determined that media types
   are outside of their scope of work [TC39-MIME-ISSUE].

   It is not possible to fully determine if a Source Text of ECMAScript
   is meant to be parsed in the Module or Script grammar goals based
   upon content alone.  Therefore, scripting environments must use out
   of band information in order to determine what goal a Source Text

   should be treated as.  To this end some scripting environments have
   chosen to adopt a new file extension of .mjs for determining the goal
   of a given Source Text.

3.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Registration

   The ECMAScript media types are to be updated to point to a non-vendor
   specific standard undated specification of ECMAScript.  In addition,
   a new file extension of .mjs is to be added to the list of file
   extensions with the restriction that it must correspond to the Module
   grammar of [ECMA-262].  Finally, the [HTML] specification is using
   text/javascript as the default media type of when preparing script
   tags; therefore, text/javascript has been moved intended usage from
   OBSOLETE to COMMON.

4.1.  text/javascript

   Type name:  text

   Subtype name:  javascript

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  charset, see section 4.1 of [RFC4329].

   Encoding considerations:  The same as the considerations in section
      3.1 of [RFC3023].

   Security considerations:  See section 5 of [RFC4329].

   Interoperability considerations:  See notes in various sections of
      [RFC4329].  This media type does not specify the grammar of
      [ECMA-262] used.

   Published specification:  [[RFCXXXX]]

   Applications which use this media type:  Script interpreters as
      discussed in [RFC4329].

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s):  n/a

      File extension(s):  .js, .mjs

      Macintosh File Type Code(s):  TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  See

4.2.  application/javascript

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  javascript

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  charset, see section 4.1 of [RFC4329].

   Encoding considerations:  The same as the considerations in section
      3.2 of [RFC3023].

   Security considerations:  See section 5 of [RFC4329].

   Interoperability considerations:  See notes in various sections of
      [RFC4329].  This media type does not specify the grammar of
      [ECMA-262] used.

   Published specification:  [[RFCXXXX]]
